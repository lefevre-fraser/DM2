  Watch these three videos and (if you were making them) describe what you would
  do differently to make them better:

  - [[https://firstthreeodds.org/videos/modulus2.mp4][Modulus]]
  - [[https://firstthreeodds.org/videos/modularInverse.mp4][Modular Inverse]]
  - [[https://firstthreeodds.org/videos/Remainder.mp4][Chinese Remaindering]]

  First post your answer.

  I would plan out my examples better (not neccessarily change them, just plan them better)
  Chinease Remainder Video - I would finish the video at least by showing the solution.

  Then post on two other students' answers.
