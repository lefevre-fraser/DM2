  This is by way of review. With that fresh on your mind, tackle the next task.

  Find a counterargument to Cantor\rsquo{}s proof that the Reals are more infinite than
  the Counting Numbers, and think about how to rebut it. This is just warmup for
  the main idea exchange task, described below.

*** Rephrase
    In order to prove that Reals are 'more infinite' than the Counting Numbers
    Prepare an argument against it and disprove it.

*** Solution
**** Counterargument
     A function like this could provide a one-to-one mapping:
       d = number of decimal points + 1
       x = number
       c = some counting number
     
     \forall c \forall x    c = f(x)
     f(x) = x * 10^dsubx 

**** Rebut
     Reals include the set of all counting numbers as well as all
     decimal numbers.

     This may work for many cases, however
     in cases like this it will not:
       x = 2, 0.002
       c = 20, 20
     
     This is not valid because the funtion is not
     a one-to-one mapping, and actually shows that there are multiple
     'x's for one c

  Refer to the animated image in DCP under the Introductory section

  [[https://rickneff.github.io/metaphors-be-with-you.html#outline-container-orgfd28ab6][Topics To Be Explored]]

  in the Book. This is the \ldquo{}finite binary tree\rdquo.

  Depicted at the link below is the \ldquo{}INFINITE binary tree\rdquo. (Naturally, this is
  only a conceptualization of something that cannot actually be drawn.) The tree
  is constructed by letting all possible paths move upward, forking infinitely
  many times. By continually halving distances, an infinite number of \ldquo{}branches\rdquo
  (or nodes) will fit below the horizontal line. Imagine each point on this line
  as being a \ldquo{}leaf\rdquo that lies at the end of one of the infinitely zigzagged
  paths up through the tree. Starting from the bottom (the root of the tree) to
  trace a complete path up to the horizontal line one makes an infinite number
  of Left-Right decisions (Left corresponding to 0 and Right to 1). For example,
  the path where the squiggly line meets the horizontal line corresponds to the
  infinite sequence: 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, .... Starting from the bottom single node,
  the number of nodes at each step doubles as the distance to the horizontal
  line halves.

  Which of the following statements is true of this tree in its finished form?

  nodes = 2^n-1 | n = number of levels
  paths = 2^(n-1) | n = number of levels
  

  - [X] It has a countable number of nodes and a countable number of paths.
  - [ ] It has a countable number of nodes and an uncountable number of paths.
  - [ ] It has an uncountable number of nodes and a countable number of paths.
  - [ ] It has an uncountable number of nodes and an uncountable number of paths.

  First post your answer.

  Then post on two other students\rsquo answers, either expanding on their answer or
  arguing why your answer is more correct than theirs.
